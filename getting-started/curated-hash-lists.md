# Curated Lists

A **curated (hash)list** is a collection of entities or assets, identifiable through a blockchain address, selected and organized by an individual or group based on specific criteria. Curators make choices that reflect their preferences, expertise, or purpose, allowing them to filter and highlight content for others. This concept can be applied both on-chain (blockchain) and off-chain (traditional systems), with a broad range of uses depending on the context.

**On-chain uses**:

* **NFT Curation**: Compiling NFTs into a list of artworks suitable for digital galleries or exhibitions.
* **DAO or Community Identification**: Identifying wallets or Universal Profiles linked to specific decentralized communities, such as DAOs, influencers, or ecosystem contributors.
* **DeFi Applications**: Assembling lists of audited and trusted DeFi smart contracts for easier access by others.
* **Reputation & Trust Scores**: Curating profiles or entities based on their social standing, achievements, or trustworthiness within decentralized applications.

These curated lists are **transparent, immutable, and reusable**, enabling anyone on the blockchain to verify their provenance and integrate them into other smart contracts or protocols. This flexibility offers the potential for a rich, decentralized digital ecosystem where personal preferences and peer-driven networks shape the experience.

**Off-chain uses**:

* **Content Recommendations**: Curating articles, videos, or other digital media in niche categories that cater to specific communities or topics.
* **Community Curation**: Similar to early internet forums, where moderators or groups would create topic-based lists of websites, blogs, or digital resources.
* **Real-world Product Collections**: Compiling lists of products or businesses that align with a certain ethos, such as eco-friendly companies or local artisanal shops.
