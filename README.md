# Hashlists: Curate the Blockchain

Those who curate your social feed curate your perception of the world. Unfortunately those in control are entities and corporations misaligned with what's best for us as individuals and humanity as a whole, but we accept our situation, feeling powerless to change it. But what if we could take back control and redesign the "attention economy" to serve us, rather than deliver us to be served? #notYourAlgoNotYourFeed

The solution lies in the blockchain -- a system that is permissionless, transparent, censorship-resistant, reusable, and configurable to match our personal goals and desires. LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs) are at the forefront of this transformation, laying the foundation for a universal social network. A key element of this vision is the Hashlists Curation Protocol, built using LSP8 Identifiable Digital Assets, which empowers users to curate their own digital experience.

With Hashlists Curated Lists, anyone can curate entities on the blockchain, shifting power away from algorithms and returning it to individuals. This approach takes us back to the early days of the internet, when people connected through raw, unfiltered interactions, discovering new worlds and ideas through chance encounters and ["stumble upons,"](https://web.archive.org/web/20040901083917/http://www.stumbleupon.com/) and not algorithmic gatekeepers. By fostering a peer-driven curatorial model, we can dismantle the groupthink and polarization propagated by centralized, algorithm-driven feeds.

Hashlists v1 offers endless possibilities. You could curate a list of NFT projects fit for a gallery, compile DeFi smart contracts that have passed audits, identify wallets or Universal Profiles associated with specific communities or DAOs, or even curate high-quality digital assets for wallet display. These curated "hashlists," named for the cryptographic hash functions that generate blockchain addresses, will exist entirely on-chain. This ensures that their provenance is verifiable, and other blockchain protocols can integrate and build upon them.

By embracing the Hashlists Curation Protocol, users and developers alike can play a vital role in reshaping the digital landscape. Together, we can move beyond centralized control and create a decentralized, pluralistic, user-driven ecosystem where authenticity and individual preferences thrive. Now is the time to reclaim our feeds and help build a future where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.
